Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report

Provide an overview that explains the purpose of this analysis.
The purpose of this project is to see if creating a logistic regression model can predict healthy loans (loan status = 0) and high risk loans (loan status = 1) based on factors such as:
•	Loan size
•	Interest rate
•	Borrower income
•	Debt to income
•	Number of accounts
•	Derogatory marks
•	Total debt

Using a bulleted list, describe the accuracy, precision, and recall scores of the machine learning model.
The results of the logistic regression classification report for both the training report and testing report are as follows:
•	In both the training and testing reports, the model was able to identify the healthy loans with accuracy at 1.00 each, however there were slight differences in identifying high risk loans with .86 on the train and .85 on the test reports.
•	On the recall scores there were differences between the two reports.  In the training report, health loans at 1.00 while in testing report the recall score was .99.  There was a slight difference in the high-risk loans with .90 on the training report while the testing report was 91, slightly higher.
•	However, the accuracy levels in both the training and testing report were at .99. This means that the ability to identify both healthy and high-risk loans was a high level.

Summarize the results from the machine learning model. Include your justification for recommending the model for use by the company.  If you don’t recommend the model, justify your reasoning.
In reviewing the data, I would recommend this model for use by the company.  The accuracy level of this model is above 95 percent predictability.
